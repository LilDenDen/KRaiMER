In this script, Jerry complains about having to pay a toll in order to use the freeway, Elaine explains that it is because tolls help maintain the roads, and George suggests taking back roads as an alternative to avoid tolls. Jerry sarcastically rejects George's suggestion by saying they would end up "lost in the middle of nowhere". We left off with Jerry's sarcastic comment.
