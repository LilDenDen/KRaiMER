"name": "Elaine",
"emotion": "Defiant",
"dialogue": "Sorry guys, but you're both wrong. Grapes are the best. They're juicy, come in different colors, and are perfect for snacking."

"emotion": "Disagreeing",
"dialogue": "Grapes? How can you even compare those to a banana or an apple?"

"name": "Jerry",
"emotion": "Skeptical",
"dialogue": "Exactly, and besides, grapes are always seeded. What's the point of that?"
},
{
"name": "Elaine",
"emotion": "Frustrated",
"dialogue": "Well, I still say grapes are the best. You guys just don't appreciate them like I do."
},
{
"name": "Jerry",
"emotion": "Teasing",
"dialogue": "Well, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one."
},

"name": "George",
"emotion": "Amused",
"dialogue": "Yeah, I guess the great fruit debate will have to continue another day."
